## Configuration

### Environment variables

To configure the port number and other environment variables, create a file ".env" and edit it just like ".env.example". The file ".env" is ignore by git, so that it can store some secret info.

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=7100
SOME_API_KEY=xxxxxxxx
```

Or use command line (before starting server):

```bash
printf "NODE_ENV=production\nPORT=7100\nSOME_API_KEY=xxxxxxxx" > .env
```
